Watch-for-deaf
==============

A arduino based project for deafs. It is prototype of a wrist watch specially designed for deafs. It alerts the person by vibration on their wrists about their any reminders or alarms. And obviously it shows time :p. It takes hover input for entering alarm time, reminders or changing time.


I used LDRs (light detecting resistors) for taking input as using premade touch panel was quite expensive.
Contents of project are a touch panel, LCD, vibrator, arduino.

Initially we need to calibrate the touch panel by letting it recieve maximum light once and then no light at all. This calculated the multiplicative factors in that light situation for the formula that i used.
After calibration,  one can proceed with different functions available by giving proper inputs.
I have made up different gestures for giving inputs. like for setting alarms, stopping alarms, reminders, setting time.
I will upload the image of gestures here.
