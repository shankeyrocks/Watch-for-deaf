Watch-for-deaf
==============

A arduino based project for deafs. It is prototype of a wrist watch specially designed for deafs. It alerts the person by vibration on their wrists about their any reminders or alarms. And obviously it shows time :p. It takes hover input for entering alarm time, reminders or changing time.
